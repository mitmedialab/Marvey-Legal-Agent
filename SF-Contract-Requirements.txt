City and its officers, agents and employees from, and, if requested, shall defend them from and
against any and all liabilities (legal, contractual, or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses,
or claims for injury or damages (collectively, “Claims”), arising from or in any way connected
with Contractor’s performance of the Term Sheet, including but not limited to, any: (i) injury to
P-648 (6-17) (SaaS Term Sheet) Page 8
or death of a person, including employees of City or Contractor; (ii) loss of or damage to
property; (iii) violation of local, state, or federal common law, statute or regulation, including but
not limited to privacy or personally identifiable information, health information, disability and
labor laws or regulations; (iv) strict liability imposed by any law or regulation; or (v) losses
arising from Contractor's execution of subcontracts not in accordance with the requirements of
this Term Sheet applicable to subcontractors; except where such Claims are the result of the sole
active negligence or willful misconduct of City. The foregoing indemnity shall include, without
limitation, reasonable fees of attorneys, consultants and experts and related costs and City’s costs
of investigating any claims against the City. In addition to Contractor’s obligation to indemnify
City, Contractor specifically acknowledges and agrees that it has an immediate and independent
obligation to defend City from any claim which actually or potentially falls within this
indemnification provision, even if the allegations are or may be groundless, false or fraudulent,
which obligation arises at the time such Claim is tendered to Contractor by City and continues at
all times thereafter.
5.1.2 Infringement Indemnification. If notified promptly in writing of any
judicial action brought against City based on an allegation that City’s use of the SaaS
Application and Services infringes a patent, copyright, or any right of a third-party or constitutes
misuse or misappropriation of a trade secret or any other right in intellectual property
(Infringement), Contractor will hold City harmless and defend such action at its own expense.
Contractor will pay the costs and damages awarded in any such action or the cost of settling such
action, provided that Contractor shall have sole control of the defense of any such action and all
negotiations or its settlement or compromise, provided, however, that Contractor shall not agree
to any injunctive relief or settlement that obligates the City to perform any obligation, make an
admission of guilt, fault or culpability or incur any expense, without City’s prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If notified promptly in writing of any
informal claim (other than a judicial action) brought against City based on an allegation that
City’s use of the SaaS Application and/or Services constitutes Infringement, Contractor will pay
the costs associated with resolving such claim and will pay the settlement amount (if any),
provided that Contractor shall have sole control of the resolution of any such claim and all
negotiations for its settlement, provided, however, that Contractor shall not agree to any
injunctive relief or settlement that obligates the City to perform any obligation, make an
admission of guilt, fault or culpability or incur any expense, without City’s prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event a final injunction is obtained
against City’s use of the SaaS Application and Services by reason of Infringement, or in
Contractor’s opinion City’s use of the SaaS Application and Services is likely to become the
subject of Infringement, Contractor may at its option and expense: (a) procure for City the right
to continue to use the SaaS Application and Services as contemplated hereunder, (b) replace the
SaaS Application and Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent substitute SaaS
Application and Services, or (c) suitably modify the SaaS Application and Services to make its
use hereunder non-infringing while retaining functional equivalency to the unmodified version of
the SaaS Application and Services. If none of these options is reasonably available to
Contractor, then the applicable Purchase Order and Corresponding Documents or relevant part of
such Purchase Order and Corresponding Documents may be terminated at the option of either
Party hereto and Contractor shall refund to City all amounts paid under this Term Sheet for the
license of such infringing SaaS Application and/or Services. Any unauthorized modification or
attempted modification of the SaaS Application and Services by City or any failure by City to
P-648 (6-17) (SaaS Term Sheet) Page 9
implement any improvements or updates to the SaaS Application and Services, as supplied by
Contractor, shall void this indemnity unless City has obtained prior written authorization from
Contractor permitting such modification, attempted modification or failure to implement.
Contractor shall have no liability for any claim of Infringement based on City’s use or
combination of the SaaS Application and Services with products or data of the type for which the
SaaS Application and Services was neither designed nor intended to be used.
5.2 Warranties of Contractor

updates thereto.

Exhibit 4
Disaster Recovery Plan: Minimum Requirements

The following represent minimum requirements that Contractor shall meet or exceed with regard
to its Disaster Recovery Plan.
A. In the case of emergency or failure, this Disaster Recovery plan will be used to restore and
continue service. Disaster Recovery is required when Contractor, in good faith, feels that an
emergency failure jeopardizes its ability to meet its Service Level Obligations. Contractor
shall use best efforts to restore operations at the same location or, at Contractor’s discretion,
a backup location. City acknowledges and agrees that such an event may result in partial or
degraded service when restored. The pre-disaster/loss level of service shall be restored as
soon as commercially reasonable.
B. Restoration Targets: Restoration of services timeframes will be defined and measured as
Recovery Point Objectives and Recovery Time Objectives.
C. Recovery Point Objective: The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is defined to be the
maximum acceptable amount of data loss for which City may experience due to a temporary
loss of hosted services and applications. Contractor shall deliver a maximum RPO of eight ()
hours based on incremental backups being made available between production and backup
facilities and recovery, if any, of production data from DCUs.
D. The Recovery Time Objective: The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum
period of continuous time during which access to the SaaS Application shall not be available
to the City. Contractor shall deliver a maximum RTO of forty-eight (48) hours for the SaaS
Application.
E. Data Synchronization: Data Synchronization is the act of replicating or “mirroring” data
from the Primary Environment to an off-site “backup” location (the Back-up Tier 2 Data
Center). Data Synchronization is to be used in the case of a Disaster Recovery event to
restore service. Data Synchronization must occur at a set interval of once per eight (8) hours
for incremental data set changes and weekly for a full backup.
F. Recovery Testing: Contractor shall regularly test and exercise the Disaster Recovery Plan to
ensure that the Tier 2 Back-up Data Center and Data Synchronization processes are
functioning as expected. City shall allow for a maximum of a two (2) week runtime within
the Back-Up Data Center before returning system operation to Primary Data Center.
G. Backup and Recovery: Backups of the production servers will occur every 8 hours, retained
for 30 days, and stored locally at the primary data center on a separate managed storage
device. These images will be used to recover servers if any issues occur. The backup images
will periodically be replicated throughout the day to the secondary staged server environment
for the purposes of site recovery. This replication will occur on a private protected fiber ring
connecting the two data centers. In the event of a site disaster, a request can be made to the
support desk and the most
